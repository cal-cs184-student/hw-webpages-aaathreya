		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, I've learned the basics of visualization centered around rasterizing images, including drawing triangles, supersampling, transform types such as rotating, translating, and scaling, texture mapping, and level sampling with mipmaps for texture mapping.
		<br>
		<br>
		In lecture, we had discussed a rasterization pipeline, that has core concepts, sampling, antialiasing, and transforms and is fundamental process that converts vector-based graphics (SVGs) into pixel-based images. In this project, I learned the groundwork for graphics rasterization, blending colors and the mathematical background (barycentric coordinates, rotations, transofrmation, texture mapping), that contributes to rendering images and shapes.




		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		The goal of this task is to implement a simple rasterizing triangle algorithm without supersampling using point-in-triangle tests by iterating through the entire image. First, we compute the bounding box of the image by finding the x-min and x-max coordinates, as well as the y-min and y-max coordinates, as the smallest rectangle that encloses the triangle. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Following computing the bounding box, I iterate through each pixel inside the bounding box, identifying the pixel center, which is (x + 0.5, y + 0.5) to see if the pixel is inside the triangle. To check whether the pixel center is inside the triangle, I identify the triangle using the intersection of three half-planes, through three line tests with the format of the implicit line equation:
		<br>
		<br>
		Since the implicit line equations calculated for each of the half-planes to construct the triangle, they are non-negative if (nextX, nextY) is on the ‘inside’ of the triangle edge. In order for a pixel center to be inside or on the boundary of the triangle, it must satisfy all three edge equations. If true, I indexed into the sample buffer, which is an array of pixels which represent the matrix, and index based on the values of the bounding box to set that pixel equal to the color passed into the function.
		<br>
		<br>
		My algorithm is no worse than one that checks every pixel within the bounding box of the triangle because it iterates through the bounds of the bounding box and performs point-in-triangle tests for each pixel to check whether it is inside the three half edges that construct the triangle. The complexity for my method in Task 1 has the same O-notation as the naive approach, it is no worse in complexity.

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>

		The supersampling algorithm that I use for rendering images is used to improve the quality of rasterized images by reducing jagged edges, or 'jaggies' that occur at the edge of triangle boundaries. In the rasterize_triangle function in rasterizer.cpp, we intially check the winding order of the edges, to ensure that the triangle has the correct orientation (counter-clockwise) when shading in for Task 2. If it is not in the correct order, then we swap the vertices to ensure it colors correctly. Next, it uses a bounding box on the current image to optimize how many times it samples the pixels. Instead of the naive rasterization we did in Task 1, we split up each pixels into multiple pixels per the sample rate and iterates over each subpixel to determine whether it falls into the triangle, and store color values in the supersample buffer, such that there were multiple colors for each subpixel sample per pixel. Similarly to the naive rasterization, we compute three lines for the triangle edges and check whether the subpixel is inside or on the boundary for the triangle edges. If it is, then we set that subpixel equal to the color that is passed into the function.
		<br>
		<br>

		Below, we show the effectiveness of supersampling by showing how the triangle is antialiased at different sampling intervals. At lower sampling intervals, we see jagged edges, and antialiasing appear with hard transitions between the triangle and background pixels. At higher sampling intervals, there are less jaggies and we see the gap in the triangle begin to be bridged; we see significantly smoother transitions, and soft transitions between the triangle and the background.

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		Below, I used the rotate and translate functions to move the arms of the cube man to show that it was waving. To the left is the original man generated by the code, and the second is the modified man. I moved the left arm down, the right arm out, and changed the color of the man's outfit to give the illusion that it was waving!

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		In simplistic terms, barycentric coordinates are used to represent the points in the triangle as a weighted average of the vertices. 
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Per the below, if we initialize the color of each triangle vertex to be something different, such as dark blue, purple, and light blue, we see each pixel as it approaches the intersections of those two colors to average out the values from each of the weighted vertices, and form a gradient. Points that are closer to a particular vertex have a greater weight, and therefore inherit more of the color. The equation for a point in barycentric coordinate is demonstrated by the below, where &alpha, &beta, and &gamma are the vertex weights that always equal to one:
